# Joycon-Colors-Database


This is just a simple Data base I've been playing around with ton build up some experience with working in SQL. The commands/Schema are aimed mostly at SQLite as that was my primary method of coding for this.



The source I used for this was the website NintendoLife (https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-joy-con-controller) which helped me to be able to locate all of the joycons currently in the wild right now. I'm going to update the list with more as I continue to improve the data base.
